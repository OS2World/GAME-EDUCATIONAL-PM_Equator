Number puzzles with a nice PM-interface for instant play.

This program is being released as shareware.  Copies may be
distributed by BBSes, FTP sites, CD-ROMs, disk vendors, etc..., with
the following conditions:

- The following files must all be present together, and unmodified when
  distributed:

  FILE_ID.DIZ    - Brief description of the document for BBS use
  LICENSE.TXT    - License terms (this file)
  REGISTER.TXT   - Registration form
  PMEQ1.EXE      - The executable
  PMEQ1.HLP      - Online Help
  PMEQ1.INI      - An Ini-File

- When distributed inside a compressed file, the prefix of that file
  should be PMEQ. The document should be listed under the name "PM-Equator"
  "v0.1" can be added.

- Vendors who have a copy which is dated more than 2 years should check
  to see if there is a newer edition before distributing the document.

- Any vendor publication which lists PMEQV01 must have a clear
  explanation of the shareware concept.  This information must be
  visible to customers before they pay a fee to the vendor.

- The FILE_ID.DIZ file and the first paragraphs of LICENSE.TXT all contain 
  text recommended for use as a description for this document.

- This document must not be bundled as part of another product
  without permission by the author.

- PMEQV01 is copyrighted shareware.  It should not be classified as
  public domain or free software.

- PMEQV01 may not be used to generate puzzles for commercial use (e.g.
  to be printed in magazines/newspapers).

GENRAL NOTE: 
      The above terms are meant to be easy to comply with.  Basically,
      distributors & users who operate legally and in fairness to
      shareware authors, are encouraged to circulate, and make use of
      this document.  In case you see a restriction which seems
      ambiguous or unfair, please contact me to see what can be worked
      out.
